# House Price Prediction Scenario

## Business Context

Mountain View Property Analytics is a boutique real-estate investment firm operating in the Boulder, Colorado metropolitan area. The firm specializes in acquiring undervalued residential properties, making strategic improvements, and selling them at competitive market prices. With a portfolio of 30-50 active properties at any given time and annual transaction volumes exceeding $15 million, accurate price predictions are critical to their business model.

## The Challenge

The firm's investment decisions hinge on precise property valuations. When evaluating potential acquisitions, even a 5% error in predicted sale price can mean the difference between a profitable flip and a costly mistake. Traditional appraisal methods are expensive (averaging $400-600 per property) and can take 7-10 days, creating delays in competitive bidding situations. The firm needs a faster, more cost-effective way to estimate market value while maintaining reliability.

## Available Data

Mountain View has compiled historical transaction data covering approximately 500 residential sales in their target market over the past three years. For each property, they've collected key features including square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year of construction, neighborhood designation (grouped into five zones based on school districts and amenities), garage capacity, overall condition scores (rated 1-10 by their inspection team), and exterior material type (brick, vinyl siding, stucco, fiber cement, or wood). These features have proven to be strong indicators of sale price in their market.

## Business Impact

A reliable machine learning model would enable Mountain View to make faster acquisition decisions, optimize their renovation budgets by identifying which improvements deliver the highest ROI, and reduce reliance on expensive third-party appraisals for preliminary valuations. The firm estimates that improving prediction accuracy by just 3% would save approximately $200,000 annually through better purchase decisions and reduced holding costs. Additionally, having instant valuations would allow them to respond to new listings within hours rather than days, providing a significant competitive advantage in Boulder's fast-moving market.
